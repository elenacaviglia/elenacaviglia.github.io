I have just completed my PhD in Mathematics at the University of Leicester (UK), under the supervision of Frank Neumann. I am interested in Category Theory and its applications to Algebraic Topology and Algebraic Geometry. My main research topics are stacks and their cohomology theories and Grothendieck fibrations.
I am a teaching assistant of the Adjoint School 2024 for the project "Properties of Double Fibrations" mentored by Dorette Pronk.

My email address is ec363@leicester.ac.uk
