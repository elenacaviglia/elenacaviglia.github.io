This is my personal webpage. I am a third-year PhD student in Category Theory (Mathematics) at the University of Leeds, UK, in the School of Mathematics.

My main research interests are the Grothendieck construction and its generalizations, enriched category theory, 2-category theory and 2-categorical elementary topoi.
