I'm a postdoc in category theory at Stellenbosch University (South Africa). Before that, I obtained a PhD in Mathematics at the University of Leicester (UK), under the supervision of Frank Neumann. I have also been a teaching assistant of the Adjoint School 2024 for the project "Properties of Double Fibrations" mentored by Dorette Pronk.

I am interested in Category Theory and its applications to algebra, topology and geometry. My current research mainly focuses on two-dimensional category theory, categorical algebra and pointfree topology.
