excerpt: 'We generalize the notion of principal bundle over a topological space to one of principal bundle in any site that has all pullbacks and a terminal object. The topological group involved in the standard notion of principal bundle becomes in general a group object in the category, and the notion of locally trivial morphism is generalized considering pullbacks along the morphisms of a covering family for the Grothendieck topology. We then use these generalized principal bundles to construct generalized quotient prestacks, and we prove that the latter are indeed prestacks. Among generalized quotient prestacks, we also consider the important particular case of classifying prestacks. We conclude the paper proving the main theorem, that states that, if the site is subcanonical and the underlying category satisfies some mild conditions, generalized quotient prestacks are stacks.'

We generalize the notion of principal bundle over a topological space to one of principal bundle in any site that has all pullbacks and a terminal object. The topological group involved in the standard notion of principal bundle becomes in general a group object in the category, and the notion of locally trivial morphism is generalized considering pullbacks along the morphisms of a covering family for the Grothendieck topology. We then use these generalized principal bundles to construct generalized quotient prestacks, and we prove that the latter are indeed prestacks. Among generalized quotient prestacks, we also consider the important particular case of classifying prestacks. We conclude the paper proving the main theorem, that states that, if the site is subcanonical and the underlying category satisfies some mild conditions, generalized quotient prestacks are stacks.
