I'm a postdoc in Mathematics at Stellenbosch University (South Africa) and a member of the National Institute for Theoretical and Computational Sciences (NITheCS).  
Before that, I obtained a PhD in Mathematics at the University of Leicester (UK), under the supervision of Frank Neumann. The title of my PhD thesis was "Generalized principal bundles and quotient stacks". 
I have also been a teaching assistant of the Adjoint School 2024 for the project "Properties of Double Fibrations" mentored by Dorette Pronk.

I am interested in applications of category theory to algebra and geometry. My current research mainly focuses on categorical algebra, abstract algebra and algebraic geometry. My broad interests also include category theory, topology and algebraic number theory.
