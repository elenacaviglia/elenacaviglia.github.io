My email address is ec363@leicester.ac.uk

I am a third-year PhD student in Mathematics at the University of Leicester (UK), under the supervision of Frank Neumann. I am interested in Category Theory and its applications to Algebraic Topology and Algebraic Geometry. My main research topics are stacks and their cohomology theories.
