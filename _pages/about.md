My email address is mmlme@leeds.ac.uk

I am a third-year PhD student in Category Theory at the University of Leeds, UK. I am currently visiting the University of Manchester, UK.

My main research interests are the Grothendieck construction and its generalizations, enriched category theory, 2-category theory and 2-categorical elementary topoi.
