An extended version of the Grothendieck construction and the lax normal conical 2-limits are intuitively produced simultaneously to essentially solve the problem of conicalizing weighted 2-limits, up to admitting 2-cells inside the cones. Then the produced Grothendieck construction is studied from a more abstract point of view, describing how it can be thought as the archetypal 3-dimensional classifier (in the sense of a would be elementary 3-topos theory) and presenting the associated notion of fibration as well. This requires to move out of the strict 2-CAT, in order to at least admit the lax natural transformations, and to consider the lax comma objects. At this point, a weak enrichment perspective leads to propose a notion of colimit and of pointwise Kan extension that suits the lax 3-dimensional context in which we need to work. Finally, a pointwise Kan extension result for the extended Grothendieck construction is established.
